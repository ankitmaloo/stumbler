🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You were right! I corrected the implementation to use the existing
"Expand the rabbit hole" widget instead of adding a new one.

✅ Modified DirectionSelector component
   → Now uses MultimodalInputBox with source="stumber"

✅ Removed duplicate "Discover More" widget
   → Was added by mistake in sidebar

✅ Same API with source tags
   → Home: source="home"
   → Stumber: source="stumber" (via "Expand the rabbit hole")


📍 WHERE TO FIND IT:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Home Page:
  • Center of screen
  • Large MultimodalInputBox
  • source="home"

Stumber Page:
  • Right sidebar
  • Inside "Expand the rabbit hole" card
  • Above "Suggested Paths" section
  • Text: "Where do you want to stumble next?"
  • source="stumber"


🧪 QUICK TEST:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Stumber Page:
   • Go to http://localhost:5173/stumber/1
   • Look for "Expand the rabbit hole" card (right sidebar)
   • Should see search box with text "Where do you want to stumble next?"
   • Enter query → Click Discover
   • F12 Network → Check request has source="stumber"

2. Home Page:
   • Go to http://localhost:5173/
   • Large search box in center
   • Enter query → Click Discover
   • F12 Network → Check request has source="home"


📂 FILES CHANGED:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. frontend/src/components/stumber/DirectionSelector.tsx
   → Replaced with MultimodalInputBox

2. frontend/src/pages/stumber.tsx
   → Removed duplicate widget


🎯 READY FOR YOUR VERIFICATION!
