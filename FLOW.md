Flow: 

- User comes on homepage. Google like. 

- If he clicks on "I am feeling lucky" goes to stumber.tsx, which opens up one of 100s of links with ai summary and some snippets. We will work on that. 

- If he enters a query, he is taken to another page which is a composite of all the web has to offer with different directions. in a rabbit hole way. Eg: i ask "whats the deal with karpathy and sutton's agi" it goes and 1/ fetches info via search 2/ organises into 7-10 headlines to be displayed with captions. 3/ generates a bunch of images to be displayed 4/ when a user clicks on one article. it generates that article text based on further drill down and progressive disclosure like thing. we will create this page. 


- on the stumber page, if a user wants to go deeper, you need suggestions below the rabbit hole box (coudl be same as generated headlines). You also need to display a chart on top which shows the rabbit hole level. (we will do this later.)
