Remember

# OVERALL:
- Servers on front end and backend are already running. Front end at 5173 and backend at 8000. NO need to run new servers. 

# UI
- Every style element should be a variable in index.css. and use tailwind's capabilities and shadcn's theming to control the styles: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming
- That is i wnat a flow such that if i change a color centrally, its reflected everywhere. 
- Use good contrast. 
- You have primary, secondary, tertiary, and accent colors each for background, text, cards, and one in which you may want to reverse it for good contrast and differentiation. First create a page where you can see all styles, check whether every combination is working (primary, secondary, tertiary, accent etc. )
- Then, for backgrounds, try and use gradients, and light effects along with glassmorphism. You dont want a cookie cutter ui, you want something that is production grade in terms of aesthetics. 

- Make sure the contrast is appropriate. 

- Use composablity

# DEVELOPMENT

- Assume server is running on ui. You can use chrome-devtools mcp to see how the ui looks. 
- IMPORTANT: Always take a screenshot and see for yourself if the color changes work. 
- IMPORTANT: If you are stuck, ask me. I like questions.
