- This is a deepdive engine. You have to follow the page layout from @frontend/src/pages/stumb.tsx. But not exactly. The ribbon etc should be there. 

User flow: 
- Step 1 is stumbling on a new topic. 
- Then options to deep dive. 
- With ai summary and what not. 
- Now you need to build in a manner which is progressive. 
- and respects the ui. 

- Overall instead of one page in iframe, you have multiple. With central one as original, and them some spawns from tehre whihc are mostly ai generated. 

Start with the page which respects the theme switcher. 

- ALWAYS RESPECT AND USE THE VARIABLES. 
- THE TOP RIBBON IS The KEY. 
- You have chrome-devtools mcp. Use that to get a screenshot and then evaluate that screenshot closely for any errors and fix those.
