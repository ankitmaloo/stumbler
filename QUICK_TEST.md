# Quick Test Guide

## ✅ DONE - API with Source Tags

Both pages use same API with different tags to identify them.

## 🧪 Quick Test

### Test Home Page (30 seconds)
1. Go to: http://localhost:5173/
2. F12 → Network tab
3. Type "test" in search box
4. Click Discover
5. Look at `multimodal-search` request
6. **Should see:** `source: "home"`

### Test Stumber Page (30 seconds)
1. Go to: http://localhost:5173/stumber/1
2. F12 → Network tab
3. Right sidebar → "Discover More" box
4. Type "test" in search box
5. Click Discover
6. Look at `multimodal-search` request

## 📋 What to Look For

### In Network Request (Payload tab):
```
✅ Home page should send:     source: "home"
✅ Stumber page should send:  source: "stumber"
```

### In Network Response (Preview tab):
```json
{
  "query": {
    "source": "home"  // or "stumber"
  },
  "message": "Processing from home page"  // or "...from stumber page"
}
```

## ✅ If Both Work → Implementation Complete!

The backend can now apply different logic based on where the search came from.
